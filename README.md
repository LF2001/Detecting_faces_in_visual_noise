Detecting faces in visual noise

Based upon Mangini & Biederman (2004), Making the ineffable explicit: 
estimating the information employed for face classifications. Cog Science. 28(2).

Present ambiguous faces superimposed with spatial frequency modulated visual 
noise. 
Participants categorise the faces in a binary fashion (male - female, etc.).
The spatial frequency modulated visual noise is later aggregated across participants and
across conditions to estimate the information used for face classification.
